## Changes

### Soul Master
- [x] HP increase to 500 in phase 1, remains the same in phase 2
- [x] Orb Attacks are no longer destroyed from hitting surfaces
- [x] Clock Attack has six orbs instead of four in a hexagon-shaped pattern
- [x] Slamming into the floor takes much less time to charge
- [ ] ~~When faking out a slam, instead of teleporting and resetting his charge time, it takes no time to charge the slam attack once teleported~~
- [x] When slamming, two soul orbs on either side of Soul Master form to slam into the ground with him. These orbs do get destroyed from hitting the floor
- [ ] ~~Gains a new attack where instead of firing an Orb at the player, he fires three Magic Missiles. They are blue, missile-shaped projectiles that will home into the player very fast. They are not affected by the floor and will disappear after four seconds~~
- [x] When doing Altered Slam in phase 2, Soul Master has two orbs on either side of him, spaced out enough that just dashing to the side will still have you get hit
- [x] When the player gets hit by any of SM’s attacks, the player will lose 33 units of soul
- [x] In phase 2, instead of firing orbs from random areas of the arena, several orbs in groups of six will form from him, rotate clockwise, counterclockwise, clockwise, etc., and move slowly away from Soul Master. These orbs are not affected by the ground/walls


### Soul Tyrant
- [x] HP is increase to 1000 in phase 1, remains the same in phase 2
- [x] Same changes as Soul Master, but faster
- [x] During the clock attack, Soul Tyrant summons two circles of four orbs. One clock spins the opposite of the other
- [ ] New Magic Missile attack summons five Missiles instead of three
- [ ] Soul Tyrant gains a new attack that teleports him to the center of the arena, summons a large orb above him, and it explodes into a circle of 10 homing orbs
- [ ] Gains another new attack where he teleports and looks like he’s about to fire an orb at the player, summons a single large orb above him and fires five deathrays from it before it disappears
- [ ] Gains another new attack where he emits electricity and fires three orbs that are also followed by electricity. After the attack he stops being electric
- [ ] ~~Gains a new attack where he teleports off screen and fires lightning from the sky after they are telegraphed. Pretty much the lightning attacks in Undertale’s Asriel Dreemur fight~~
